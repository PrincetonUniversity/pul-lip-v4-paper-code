There are cells that respond best to the cue (common in visual areas) and cells that respond best to the target which appears at the cued location (common in LIP) as well as cells that show stimulus-induced suppression (which carries information about the stimulus). This cell responds well (and consistently over 17 trials) to the target at P3 in the zero distracter condition (weakish response to cue at P3, which may be due to the fact that the task can still be performed without the cue in the 0 distracter case, but still a response). In the 5 distractor condition, the best (although moderate) cue-evoked response is at P3, and the poor response to the target may be due to surround inhibition. In summary, there are sufficient trials to perform the analysis, so I suggest we should include the cell.",,,

C110812,1b,x,x,2,x,x,"RF choice unclear. P6 has highest mean spike rate after cue (particularly if you look until 250ms after cue). This is a little clearer looking at the raster, because the baseline-corrected spdf y-axis is very high (compressing the responses). Ex RF: P2 for sufficient trials. Although the small number of trials makes the interpretation of this cell difficult, I think the fact that this cell 1b was recorded at the same location as 1a, helps to make the decision that the RF is P6 (same as 1a).

L110411,1a,x,x,0,x,x,"Exclude. Only 37 trials. Sparse firing. RF choice unclear. No increase in spike rate to stimuli. However, although the cell has low spontatneous rate, it does seem that P2 cues and arrays induce some suppression, e.g., target at P4, where there seems to be post-suppression bursts/rebound. So while I wouldn't use this cell for the latency analysis (based on increased spiking), it may be useful to include in the population spdf for cells showing stimulus-induced suppression. Given the low spontaneous rate and few trials, it does not seem to me that there is selective suppression for a cue location. I agree that the late response for P4 is suggestive of a post-suppresive burst/rebound, but it could also represent preparatory activity for a lever release or saccade to the shape (the trials are sorted firstly by cue location, secondly by shape, thirdly by congruency; so those trials with the post-suppressive burst are likely all barrel trials.
